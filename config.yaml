title: GPT-3 Playground (Alpha)
description: |
  Use GPT3 to help analyze your documents, right within DocumentCloud. Note
  that this Add-On consumes AI credits, which you can get via a Pro or Organization
  account.

  Give this a full prompt that you would pass into GPT-3 and it will run it
  against your selected documents, one at a time. The Add-On currently looks at 
  the first 12,000 characters in each document, which is about six pages of text on average.
  
  We'd love your feedback and ideas â€” drop a note to info at documentcloud dot org or join
  us in the News Nerdery Slack in the #proj-documentcloud channel.
