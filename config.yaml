title: "GPT-3.5 Turbo Playground"
description: |
  Use GPT3 to help analyze your documents, right within DocumentCloud.

  Give this a full prompt that you would pass into GPT-3 and it will run it
  against your selected documents, one at a time. 
  
  The Add-On currently looks at the first 56,000 characters in each document.
  If using an average page size of 300 words per page or 1750 characters per page, 
  that is around 30 pages or so. 

  The Add-On cost is approximately 1 AI credit per page, if your document has around 1750 characters per page. 
  If your document has much more text per page, it may be more costly. 
  
  There is a dry-run option that tells you the cost of running the Add-On on your entire set without charging you. 
  The cost is capped at 30 AI credits per document per run. 

  If you have large documents but only care about the first 1000 characters in the document, you can set a limiter
  so that it costs less to run the Add-On. You can set the limit between 1,000 - 56,000 characters.
